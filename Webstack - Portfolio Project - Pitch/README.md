# Webstack - Portfolio Project - Pitch

`Group project`  `Portfolio project`  `Presentation`

#### Concepts
*For this project, we expect you to look at this concept*

* [Portfolio project](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/548)

## Last run!
Yes! the portfolio project of the Back-end specialization will be your last-major-project!

### Make your choice
You will have almost 2 weeks to develop your portfolio project - during this period you will be alone or by team - to create a fully functional web application.

Be before starting any coding, you will need to research and define the project.

This project is important:

* Because it will end your pathway at Holberton
* It’s summarize the entire Back-end specialization
* The weight of this project is important in your overall score
* You can be as creative as you want
* And the most important: **You should be proud of it** - it will be THE project to show off during interview

### Solo or by team?
Good question right?

The first question you should ask yourself is: **what I want to do?**

Front-end app? Mobile app? Back-end app? API service? e-commerce website? cloud platform for videos streaming? or better: a learning platform?

Don’t be afraid to work in a team - “more resources” means bigger project - but also more soft-skills.

Working solo is also fine - just don’t think too big or find quick-win to achieve your project.

### No idea?
Be creative doesn’t mean “create a web application that will make the world a better place” - no - it means: do what you really want: it can be applying concept your learn during the curriculum - it can be exploring a new technology (Go, Rails, etc.) - or make a clone of an existing platform (I was not joking about the learning platform or video streaming…)

Try to solve a problem or learn!

Also, a web application doesn’t only mean “Website”, it can also be just an API.

### Steps of this portfolio project
To end the curriculum, the portfolio project is split in 3 parts:

* The pitch (this project)
* The development

Ready? Go!

### More Info

#### Manual QA Review
Review and approval for your portfolio project must be done by a staff member.

## Tasks

### 0. Pitch me your idea!
As mentioned in the beginning of this project, you have some questions to ask yourself:

* Solo or team?
* What do I want to build?
* How do I want to build it?
* Is it possible to build it in less than 2 weeks?
* Do I like what I’m doing?

When you know these answers, you will have to prepare a pitch:

* Max 10min of pitch (please repeat to not go over)
* Google slide presentation with:
	* Name of the project
	* List of team members
	* Description of the project
	* Learning objectives
	* Technologies used
	* Third services used if applicable
	* Challenges already identified
	* Schedule of work (by using [Trello](https://trello.com/en) or [Kanban board](https://kanbanflow.com/) or other) - don’t forget that you have less then 4 weeks (27 days exactly)
	* Mock-ups if applicable

Please post your slides here and the staff will organize a “pitching day”

Let’s do it!
